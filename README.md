This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## CRUD Page Access

Open [http://localhost:3000/crud](http://localhost:3000/crud) to go to the project page.

## Concepts Exercised

This project was created in order to better understand the nextJs framework, along with a few core concepts to web development.
A few examples:
- Routing in nextjs which uses a folder's name for its route construction;
- Prop communication between father and child components;
- State management;
- Typescript's type enforcement;
- Folder management for better organization and understanding for other users;
- Partial types which allows empty values;
- Type recasting;
- Working with interface for prop organization;
- Tailwind's exclusive keywords such as @apply;
